#Project Specifications
Realization and Visualization for the Electoral Campaign of a Candidate in the Recent U.S. Presidential Elections

The electoral staff can visualize state preferences for a candidate through a choropleth map. Additionally, they can see preferences for each state, the projection of electoral votes for the final victory, and compare two states to decide where to focus the campaign efforts.

#Local Development
The project can be run by executing the command python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port] for Python 2 or python -m http.server [port] if using Python 3. After that, open your browser and type http://localhost:[port].
